# How to use

Just call `crcdir` to checksum the current directory, or optionally specify the directory to check as the first argument.

# How to install

```
cargo install crcdir
```

# How to build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/GallagherCommaJack/crcdir
cd crcdir
cargo build --release
```

You may get a speedup by specifying your CPU architecture manually.
